UTSU - A cross-platform vocal synthesis frontend

Compatible (in theory) with all voicebanks, files, and engines created with or for the UTAU software--however, the two programs have no code in common and both user features and backend processing can and will be different.

To build from source:
Please install Maven v. 4.0.0 or higher.
Please ensure your Java version is 8 or higher.

Navigate to the same directory as the pom.xml file and type:
> mvn clean verify
in the command line.  You can look up various other Maven commands to test, deploy, etc.
